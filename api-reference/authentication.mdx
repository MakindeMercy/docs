The FAAN API uses basic authentication for securing access to its endpoints.

## Authentication Method:
- **Type**: Basic Auth
- **Header**: Authorization
- **Format**: The authentication credentials are passed via the Authorization header using username and password.

```bash
{Authorization: 'Basic <username><password>'}
```

## How to Authenticate:
All API endpoints require you to include an Authorization header with basic authentication credentials in your requests.

### Example:

If you are calling the account types endpoint, you would include the following header in your request:
```curl
curl --request GET \
  --url https://gemsupgrade.gemscloud.app/faan-pfs-middleware/api/account-types/fetch-all \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <your-username><your-password>'
```
